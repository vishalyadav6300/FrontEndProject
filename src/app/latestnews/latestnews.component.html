             <p>
                Argentina forward Sergio Aguero has cast doubt on holding the Copa America while the coronavirus pandemic rages in the region, just hours after Brazilian 
                President Jair Bolsonaro pushed ahead with late plans to host the tournament.
                Bolsonaro on Tuesday said five governors have agreed to host matches in the South American continental event, which is scheduled to kick off June 13. But Aguero and the international playersâ€™ union, FIFPRO, are not convinced the tournament should go ahead.

                The penalty was only awarded after a lengthy VAR consultation during which Mexico coach Gerardo Martino was sent off for confronting the referee.Mexico then had a penalty saved late on by substitute keeper Ethan Horvath.
                "I'm kind of speechless to be honest," Horvath said after the inaugural final."If you're on the bench as a keeper you don't expect to come in the game.
